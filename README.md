###AI Unit Testing for Angular using Private LLM (Qwen-0.5-Coder) Overview

This project provides an AI-powered unit testing framework for Angular applications using a privately hosted Large Language Model (LLM) based on Qwen-0.5-Coder (0.5B). The model is fine-tuned on custom Angular source code and corresponding unit test datasets to automatically generate high-quality Jasmine/Karma test cases.

The system is designed for secure, offline, and enterprise environments where source code confidentiality is a priority. All inference and fine-tuning operations are performed locally or within private infrastructure, with no dependency on external cloud-based AI services.

Key Features
Automated unit test generation for Angular applications

Private LLM deployment using Qwen-0.5-Coder

Fine-tuned model trained on Angular-specific code and tests
